# Requirements

## Introduction
    Features of soil like pH, N, P, K are important values which determine Which
crop is suitable for growing in that particular land, But At present Farmer is not
Selecting according to above values this will create a issue it will makes the farmer
to be in loss, will not get proper yield of profit in the end. To overcome problem
we have applying Machine Learning technique history of Crop yield Information
of the region
## Objectives
* Recommend a Suitable Crop to farmer based on his region soil features surface temperature, rainfall from dataset which is gathered from Open Government Data (data.gov.in)
* Study various Classification Algorithms in machine learning and analyze
which classifier is suitable for Crop Recommendation
* Predict the Crop price monthly changes by analyzing dataset of Wholesale
price index, Rainfall and Base price of market

## Research
* Earlier there was Manual identification of soil in lab.
* The measurement of moisture content is not precise.
* Crops for a certain soil cannot be specified for a particular area.
* Time-consuming.
* Crop yield reduction.
* No forecasting and the traditional technique are used.


## Cost and Features
### *Cost*
Since the system uses only open source software, it is free of cost..!!

*TBD*

### *Features*
The various features of the system are:
* Recommending the crop helps the agriculture and cropping seasonal will
help the farmer
* Proposing the elective turn will help in supporting the Soil ripeness
* Using the classifiers which helps us determine the better crop to when compared single classifier
* Accuracy is improved.
* Crops suitable for the soil type are identified.
*  Manuals is reduced and Time consumption is minimized.
* Concentrated on crop growth depending on regional factors and Forecasting to get a good yield

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

The tool is a helping hand for young children who would like to counter verify their conversions and also for scientific researchers and mathematicians.

## What:

A metric conversion calculator that does metric conversions in few seconds.

## When:

When people are struggling with simple conversions or when kids would like to cross verify their answers while practicing or when people need conversion results in a jiffy to proceed on further with their calculations. 

## Where:

Can be put to use where simple or advanced scientific and mathematic calculations requiring conversions are involved.

## How:

The system opens up to the standard list of metric conversions that are available. Upon selection of one the standard system, the list of inter-conversions i.e., the sub-system is shown on the screen. The user can now choose one sub unit that needs to be converted into one or more other sub units that is available on the list.  The results for all these conversions are flashed in a second.
